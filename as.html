Sure! Here's a simple webpage that helps users navigate different web development-related websites. The hyperlinks will open in a new tab when clicked.

### HTML Code
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Web Development Resources</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Web Development Resources</h1>
    <p>Click on the links below to explore various web development-related websites:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take me to <a href="PW Skill/" target="_blank">PW Skill</a>to buy a COURSE.</li>
        <li>Take me to <a href="MDN Doc" target="_blank">MDN Doc</a> to know about more web develpment</li>
        <li> Take me to <a href="PW Skill Lab" target="_blank">PW Skill Lab</a> to practice live coding.</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation
- The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks.
- The `target="_blank"` attribute ensures that the links open in a new tab.
- The `<ul>` and `<li>` tags are used to create an unordered list of links.

You can save this code as an HTML file and open it in a browser to see the webpage in action. If you need any further customization or additional features, feel free to ask!
